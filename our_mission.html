    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p> Project Advocation was founded by three high schoolers as a result of their first-hand experience with the American education system, in which they found that disparity in education present within both America and the educational climate as a whole was in need of remedy through student-led initiatives.</p>

<p>This inequality, in conjunction with the increasing need for advocacy initiatives due to the greater social dissonance present in the modern epoch, led to their idea to found an organization that was dedicated to both assuaging educational inequality and promoting equal opportunity. As this organization would thus be devoted in equal measure to educating students to enrich their scholastic experience, and advocating for social, economic, and infrastructural opportunity, said organization was dubbed Project Advocation, a portmanteau of advocate and education.</p>

<p>Project Advocation is a student-led, not-for-profit organization with a mission to both transform K-12 education by offering free and innovative tutoring through hands-on learning experiences focused on medical science, literature, and computer science, and to advocate for current issues in these fields by developing and leading projects in both our immediate community and worldwide.<p>

<p>As exemplified by this mission, Project Advocation provides pathways to fundraising for those in need in our community, essential good drives to assuage any shortages for those in need, and other methods to advocate for the well-being of those who require assistance. We offer tutoring free of charge to children of all ages in a variety of subjects, and collaborate via partnerships with other organizations to provide diverse, educational opportunities to adolescents and younger children worldwide. Through these initiatives, we hope to enrich the learning of students and support equality around the world.</p>
